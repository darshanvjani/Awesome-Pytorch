# Skelaton Model Base
## Target
-> Get the set-up right

-> Set Transforms

-> Set Data Loader

-> Set Basic Working Code

-> Set Basic Training  & Test Loop

## Results:

-> Parameters: 6.3M

-> Best Training Accuracy: 99.99

-> Best Test Accuracy: 99.24

## Analysis:

-> Extremely Heavy Model for such a problem

-> Model is over-fitting, but we are changing our model in the next step [Skelaton Model Base (CODE))](https://github.com/darshanvjani/Awesome-Pytorch/blob/main/EVAI6/Code%20Drill%20Down%20(Model%20Building)/Skeleton_Model.ipynb)

# Skelaton_v1.0 Model 
## Target

-> Get the basic skeleton right. We will try and avoid changing this skeleton as much as possible. 

-> No fancy stuff

## Results:

-> Parameters: 194k

-> Best Train Accuracy: 99.35

-> Best Test Accuracy: 99.02

## Analysis:

-> The model is still large, but working. 

-> **We see some over-fitting** [Skelaton_v1.0 Model (CODE))](https://github.com/darshanvjani/Awesome-Pytorch/blob/main/EVAI6/Code%20Drill%20Down%20(Model%20Building)/Skeleton_Model_v1_0.ipynb)
